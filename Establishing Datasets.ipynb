Then afterwards, I will test the robustness of this model using the TextAttack framework to see how well the model will combat against semantic attacks at small budgets with standard constraints. Then, for each baseline model I'll use a upgraded variation to test how effective different defensive stratgies are for TextAttack.\n","\n","This will all be evaluted through a report of clean accuracy, robust accuracy vs. edit budget, attack success rate, and testing a couple of defense strategies."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"5a44dac0-0d2f-4fc9-b2c8-8b3dbb2828bb","metadata":{"id":"5a44dac0-0d2f-4fc9-b2c8-8b3dbb2828bb"},"source":["## Problem & Hypothesis:\n","\n","---\n","\n","**Problem:** How well can small, targeted changes *(via discrete token edits)* to text inputs can cause a classifier to misidentify whether an email is a phishing attack or not?

Word Viewer is what i used back in the day to convert\\nWord 97 docs to Word 95, as you could display the Word 97 doc and copy &\\npaste the text (with formatting) into Word 95, which was the only\\nversion of Word that i had.  anyways, a little nostalgia.\\n\\n> > I don't have a Windows machine, so it becomes problematic to convert them;\\n> > I know that if this were not the case, in Word I could save them as some\\n> > other more friendly format.\\n\\ni have a windows (dual-boot) machine, but it only get used by my\\nsignificant other and for burning multi-session cd-r/rw.  (is there any\\nlinux gui app that supports cdrecord's multi-session feature?)  since\\nOpenOffice, i've been able to edit Word docs flawlessly (or at least the\\nsimple Word documents i receive from others).\\n\\nanyways...\\n-- \\n\\nPLEASE REQUEST PERMISSION TO REDISTRIBUTE\\n   AUTHOR'S COMMENTS OR EMAIL ADDRESS.\\n\\n\\n\\n-------------------------------------------------------\\nThis sf.net email is sponsored by: OSDN - Tired of that same old\\ncell phone?

Dear , I am writing to you, following the impressive information about you through the Web,and I believe in your capability and reliability to champion this opportunity.I am the Operations Officer, BILL AND EXCHANGE of THE FOREIGN REMITTANCE DEPARTMENT OF CITIZENS INTERNATIONAL BANK LTD,LAGOS.NIGERIA.In my department,we discovered an abandoned sum of 17.5 million US dollars Seventen million five hundrend US dollars) in an account that belongs to one of our foreign customers who died along with his entire family in 0ctomber,1998 in a plane crash. Since we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next of Kin to come over and claim his money because we can not release it unless some body applies for it as next of Kin or relative to the deceased as indicated in our banking and financial policies but unfortunately we learnt that his supposed next of kin or relation died with him in the accident leaving nobody behind to claim the money. It is therefore upon this discovery that I and other officials in my department now decided to make this business proposal to you and release the money to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and we dont want this money to go into the Bank treasury as unclaimed bills. The Banking law and guide line here stipulates that if such money remained unclaimed after Six and half years, the money will be transferred into the Bank treasury as unclaimed fund.The request for a foreigner as next of kin in this business is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner and an indigene cannot stand as next of kin to the deceased family. We agreed that 30% of this money will be for you as foreign partner, in respect of your assistance in this business, and 70 % would be for me and two of my staff in the business. Thereafter,I and my colleagues will visit your country for disbursement according to the percentages indicated.Therefore, to enhance the immediate transfer of this fund to you as arranged,you must apply first to the Bank as relation or next of kin of the deceased indicating your private, telephone and fax number for easy and effective communication and location where the money will be remitted. Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or e-mail the text of the application.I will not fail to bring to your notice that this transaction is hitch free and that you should not entertain any atom of fear as all required arrangements have been made for the transfer.You should contact me on MY E-MAIL, as soon as you receive this letter. I decided to contact you as you have products of interest in your part of the world where we can invest our own percentage to avoid peoples awareness as we are civil servants. Note that we can conclude this operation within ten banking days.Please keep this very confidential for obvious security reasons. Contact me for more information, all confirmable before you apply if you want. Trusting to hear from you shortly for a detailed information which are confirmable before you can make up your mind to apply.If however,you are not interested,do let me know by return mail too as I will not contact anybody else until I hearfrom you.Reach me immediately through my private emailaddress at:nzamo__ben@myway.com May God be with you.

it even has some emails records dating from 2022. While my preferred date range was somewhere between 2020 - 2025, I couldn't find a more recent email dataset as this was the only reliable (and free) dataset I could get my hands on that had even had records of a 2020+ timestamp. Whether this was because of COVID or just the security issues of obtaining that dataset I'm not sure, but I plan to only use the \"relevant\" records when I clean the dat\n","2. .\n","The secain reason I chose this dataset was how they formatted the features of each email (i.e, subject, body, sender, reciever, date, etc.). This was important to me as not only did I need the timestamps of each email to ensure relevancy but I also needed the domains involved with each email so I can perform RDAP and DNS look for my defensive strategy against TextAttack\n","\n","With this dataset, through the reasons I provided I'll be able to obtain an email dataset that will sufficiently simulate real-world email samples by ensuring that the dataset is at least somewhat relevant to this point in time and has the provided information to analyze suspicious domain and RDAP behavior in regards to phishing attacks and to use that for classification models.ps."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"90d16419-23bb-4e9d-aeb2-87fb01d61fa3","metadata":{"id":"90d16419-23bb-4e9d-aeb2-87fb01d61fa3"},"source":["**Awareness of state-of-the-art / Substantive literature review with proper citations:** Some papers I've read that influenced the idea of my project include...\n","\n","1. *Hao, S., Kantchelian, A., Miller, B., Paxson, V., & Feamster, N.

Similar to how Professor Verma explained in previous lectures, it explains how \"addresses common issues in phishing research—such as class imbalance, outdated samples, and inconsistent preprocessing—by applying a unified cleaning and anonymization pipeline.\". Thus leads to many of these models to result in unrealistic accuracy. Following their approach, I plan to create a structured and clean dataset that ensures relevancy by using no email older than 2015, properly cleaning the dataset from duplicates, missing values, and domain info. The paper also provided a table list of datasets they used which provides some confidence to the dataset I obtained from Zenodo as both have some overlap in both the data and features they use.1"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"19b14baf-301f-4817-ba4b-105fcdfb2e6d","metadata":{"id":"19b14baf-301f-4817-ba4b-105fcdfb2e6d"},"source":["**Awareness of state-of-the-art:**\n","\n","3. *Maneriker, P., Stokes, J.
